1. Prefix. How about `a-` for **atomic**? Smallest element. How useful would this be?
2. Heading. _Should_ define headings in `/src/assets/css/settings/`. But, a little bit complicated. As is HTML element, maybe in its own file? `typography.css`? It sure ainâ€™t a module. CSSWizardry uses eg `.u-h1`. But then, that separates the definition from the original definition, one in settings and one in utiltiies.
