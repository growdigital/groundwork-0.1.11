A Twitter account for Groundwork has **just been set up**!

[GroundworkRocks](https://twitter.com/GroundworkRocks)

As soon as I get the `metalsmith-feed` plugin working, I’ll pipe out the posts to the Twitter account. I’ll also pipe them out to [growdigital](https://twitter.com/growdigital). Coming at you from all sides. Oh yes.
