How hard can it be to make an animated GIF showing how to install Groundwork?

PRETTY BLOODY HARD

is the answer.

I’d previously tooled up with [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) for a contract that never flew, so I’ve been trying my hand at this new fangled screen-castering malarkey. What a lot of messing about.

Anyway, the good news is that I’ll put an animated GIFs together that is less than 108MB in size and post it on the website tomorrow. Honest.
