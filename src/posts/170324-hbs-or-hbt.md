I wasn’t sure if the file extension for [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is `.hbt` or `.hbs`, so I asked on the friendly [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) [Slack channel](https://metalsmith.slack.com/), and an answer came back from Woody:

It’s all these little details that take the time. And I haven’t even started writing the documentation.
