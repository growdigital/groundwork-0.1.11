Thanks to [@leviwheatcroft](https://twitter.com/leviwheatcroft)’s plugin [metalsmith-move](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/metalsmith-move), I’ve been able to move(!) all my image assets out of their individual CSS module folders into `/assets/images/`. This is A Good Thing, makes image linking much simpler.

In other news:

* the [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) styleguide is now working at [`/styleguide/`](/styleguide/), although the styles aren’t being pulled in yet!
* I have setup auto-tweets on the [GroundworkRocks](https://twitter.com/GroundWorkRocks) twitter account from the website [RSS feed](), using [dlvr.it]().
* I’m in the midst of creating a blank “white label” template, which will become the canonical [Groundwork project]() itself. In the meantime if you’d like to try it out, use [Groundwork.Rocks]()

So, _soon_ there will be a `0.1.0` release of Groundwork, which will make me very happy, happy enough to embark upon a social media marketing campaign blitz.
