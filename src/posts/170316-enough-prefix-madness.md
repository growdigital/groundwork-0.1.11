[CSSWizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) [writes about](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) using the prefix `c-` for **component** modules.

I find it a bit too cluttered, so I have decided not to use it for components.

Components are “discrete, complete chunks of UI”, and they are commonplace. So the rule is, if it doesn’t have a prefix, it must be a component type of module.
