The animated GIF with [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) turned out to be 1.8MB, which is a bit big for what is essentially these commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:growdigital/groundwork.git
$ cd groundwork
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

So, I made a **plain text** screencast with the fabulous [asciinema](https://asciinema.org):

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/dstnak4qnlo13kgfc3wrvpfz2.js" id="asciicast-dstnak4qnlo13kgfc3wrvpfz2" async data-speed="2" data-theme="solarized-dark"></script>

It’s double speed and a _bit_ boring. But the good news is that, if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, you can have a Modular CSS website running in **1 minute and 30 seconds**. Pretty cool.

There is a way to [edit recorded asciicasts](https://asciinema.org/docs/faq) but I haven’t figured it out yet.
