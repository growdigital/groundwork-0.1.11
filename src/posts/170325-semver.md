I just set up [semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Degree_of_compatibility) for [Groundwork](/) with [semver.org](http://semver.org/), using the [interactive guide to `package.json`](http://browsenpm.org/package.json) as a guide. I like semantic versioning, it appeals to my tidy side. Also, it makes a great deal of sense for any sane method of development, web or whatever. 

Along the same lines, I can also heartily recommend [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/), casts a big shining light on all this plugin semantic versioning for [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).
