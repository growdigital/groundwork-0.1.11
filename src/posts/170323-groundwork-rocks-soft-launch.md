[Groundwork](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/) is a Module CSS Starter Kit. Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, download the repo, then just run this in a terminal:

```
$ npm run dev
```

It’s _so_ new that it doesn’t even have [semantic versioning]() yet.

The website [www.groundwork.rocks](https://www.groundwork.rocks/) unofficially went live yesterday. I registered the domain with the excellent [iwantmyname.com](https://iwantmyname.com/) folks, and it’s deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). There’s even a badge for it:

[![Deploys by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-dark.svg)](https://www.netlify.com)

Soon as I get everything work just about, I’ll post a message here on this blog.
