The trouble with Open Source software is that you just can’t give it away.

**Money** is only one part of the equation, of more importance is the investment of **time** and **effort**. 

Groundwork is [Open Source software](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/0.2.0/LICENSE) (dual licensed under [GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) and [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)), so that puts the money to one side. 

I’ve been reading [How we got our 2-year-old repo trending on GitHub in just 48 hours](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-we-got-a-2-year-old-repo-trending-on-github-in-just-48-hours-12151039d78b) and there’s some good advice in there, namely **make it easy for people to understand and use**. Reduce the time and effort people have to spend. Reduce friction.

To that end, I’ve rewritten the [README](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/0.2.0/README.md) and created a [Slack channel](https://groundworkrocks.slack.com/). My arbitary but achievable aim is to have **100 stars** for the project by the end of the year. So, please feel free to [give Groundwork a star](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork) :)
