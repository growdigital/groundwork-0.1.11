# About Groundwork

> CSS frameworks are like opinions: everybody’s got one and everyone thinks everyone else’s stinks.

_(with apologies to Dirty Harry)_

Groundwork is **very simple**. It is a [Static Site Generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) ([Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)) modified to allow you to write modular CSS and JavaScript.

Modular CSS is when styles are written for individual modules (components, objects, utilities) and then combined into one style sheet.

Cobbled together by [Jake Rayson](https://growdigital.org/), a frontend designer and forest gardener.
