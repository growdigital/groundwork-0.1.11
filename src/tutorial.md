# Tutorial

This _will_ be a step-by-step tutorial to get you up and running with Groundwork, creating your own CSS modules in next to no time.

It will feature **animated GIFs** and possibly **hand-drawn animals**!

Don’t forget, you can always “grow your own” Modular CSS system with a taskrunner like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Broccoli.js](http://broccolijs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) etc.
