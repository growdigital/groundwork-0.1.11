# Styleguide

A guiding principle in [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) process management is **make work visible** (Kanban 看板 literally means billboard in Japanese).

This is why a styleguide is **so** important.

Groundwork comes bundled with [Fractal](http://fractal.build/), a magnificent, _automated_, styleguide builder. So long as your module folder has an HTML template file (we use [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)), then the module will appear in your styleguide.

Big kudos to [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) by [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) – very inspirational work. I find the idea attractive but I don’t get on with the layered granularity. Worth a look though, as is [http://styleguides.io/](http://styleguides.io/) a website of **styleguides** curated with [Anna Debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham)   :)
