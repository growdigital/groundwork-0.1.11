## What is Groundwork?

Groundwork is a complete starter kit for writing Modular CSS. Modular CSS is a way of rationalising and organising your CSS (and other assets) into discrete and re-usable chunks.

The process is simple: individual CSS files are combined into one stylesheet.

The hard work is _how_ to organise your CSS into modules. Groundwork has strong opinions [about the structure](/organisation), using the [inverted CSS triangle]() idea by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) and dividing modules between concrete `components` and abstract `objects`.

Frontend development is an _organic_ process, where you _grow_ a system of CSS by seeing what is needed. But always with a process of **review** and **consolidation**. 

## Who is Groundwork for?

* Frontend developers who want a quick-start Modular CSS system. 
* Frontend designers & developers who want a working system out-of-the-box.
* Anyone who wants a starting point to learn about creating a Modular CSS system.

## Why should I use it?

Because it is easy and quick! Feel free to take any ideas, structure, syntax, scaffolding, organisation etc. and re-fashion them in your own image.

Obviously, you can grow your own Modular CSS system with a taskrunner like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Broccoli.js](http://broccolijs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) etc.
