# Blank Modular CSS Starter Kit

See [www.groundwork.rocks](https://www.groundwork.rocks) for instructions. 

Quick start:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:growdigital/groundwork.git
$ cd groundwork
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Useful for

1. Proof-of-concept: Modular CSS is this easy.
2. Starter for your own [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) blog.
3. Crib-sheet for creating your own Modular CSS with styleguide.

## Make it your own

Change the `package.json` and `index.js` to make the project truly yours. And start styling it away from these intentionally drab and dreary colours:

```css
white
gainsboro
gray
dimgray
black 
```
