## What is Groundwork?

Groundwork is a complete starter kit for writing Modular CSS. Modular CSS is a way of rationalising and organising your CSS (and other assets) into discrete and re-usable chunks.

The process is simple: individual CSS files are combined into one stylesheet.

The hard work is _how_ to organise your CSS into modules. Groundwork has strong opinions [about the structure](/organisation), using the [inverted CSS triangle]() idea by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) and dividing modules between concrete `components` and abstract `objects`.

Frontend development is an _organic_ process, where you _grow_ a system of CSS by seeing what is needed. But always with a process of **review** and **consolidation**.
