## What is it?

A quick way to start writing [modular CSS]() with a fully-fledged [static site generator]() and [styleguide]().

Modular CSS is a way of organising your CSS, and other assets, into discrete and re-usable chunks.

## How do I start?

Make sure to have [Node.js]() and [git]() installed. Wherever you build your websites:

```
$ git clone
$ cd groundwork
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

```

## Why did you make it?

Modular CSS frameworks like [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info) are fantastic and robust solutions but built for BIG websites. 

I wanted a much simpler "boilerplate" for my own projects, hence Groundwork.

## Who is it for?

Frontend developers and web designers who want a quick start with mnodular CSS to build relatively small websites.

Obviously, you can grow your own Modular CSS system with a taskrunner like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Broccoli.js](http://broccolijs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) etc.
