# Quick and easy Modular CSS

A quick way to start writing [modular CSS](/principles/), Groundwork is easy to install and comes complete with a fully-fledged [static site generator](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and [styleguide](http://fractal.build/).

Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:growdigital/groundwork.rocks.git
$ cd groundwork.rocks
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

<strong>NB:</strong> this will setup a copy of the [Groundwork Rocks](https://www.groundwork.rocks/) website, which is in **0.0.x version**! Currently working on creating a blank template.

Groundwork is for web designers and frontend developers who are comfortable with the terminal and who want to wrap their heads around the how to Modular CSS works.
