# Quick and easy Modular CSS

A quick way to start writing [modular CSS](/principles/), Groundwork is easy to install and comes complete with a fully-fledged [static site generator](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and [styleguide](http://fractal.build/).

Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:growdigital/groundwork.git
$ cd groundwork
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

See the posts for a step-through tutorial on using Groundwork, or visit the website for some background information: [www.groundwork.rocks](https://www.groundwork.rocks)

## Make it your own

Change the `package.json` and `index.js` to make the project truly yours. And start styling it away from these intentionally drab and dreary colours:

```css
white
gainsboro
gray
dimgray
black 
```
Groundwork is for web designers and frontend developers who are comfortable with the terminal and who want to wrap their heads around the how to Modular CSS works.
