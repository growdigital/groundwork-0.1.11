## What is it?

A quick way to start writing [modular CSS](/principles/) with a fully-fledged [static site generator](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and [styleguide](http://fractal.build/).

Modular CSS is a way of organising your CSS, and other assets, into discrete and re-usable chunks.

## How do I start?

Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Run these commands in your terminal wherever you build your websites:

```
$ git clone
$ cd groundwork
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

```

## Why did you make it?

Modular CSS frameworks like [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info) are fantastic and robust but they are built for BIG websites.

I wanted a much simpler “boilerplate” for my own projects.

## Who is it for?

Frontend developers and web designers who want a quick start with modular CSS to build relatively small websites.
