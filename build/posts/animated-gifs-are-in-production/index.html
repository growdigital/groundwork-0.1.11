  <p>How hard can it be to make an animated GIF showing how to install Groundwork?</p>
<p>PRETTY BLOODY HARD</p>
<p>is the answer.</p>
<p>I’d previously tooled up with <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">Screenflow</a> for a contract that never flew, so I’ve been trying my hand at this new fangled screen-castering malarkey. What a lot of messing about.</p>
<p>Anyway, the good news is that I’ll put an animated GIFs together that is less than 108MB in size and post it on the website tomorrow. Honest.</p>
