  <h1>Trending on GitHub</h1>
  <time>Tue 28 Mar 2017</time>
  <p>The trouble with Open Source software is that you just can’t give it away.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong> is only one part of the equation, of more importance is the investment of <strong>time</strong> and <strong>effort</strong>. </p>
<p>Groundwork is <a href="https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/0.2.0/LICENSE">Open Source software</a> (dual licensed under <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/">GPL</a> and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>), so that puts the money to one side. </p>
<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-we-got-a-2-year-old-repo-trending-on-github-in-just-48-hours-12151039d78b">How we got our 2-year-old repo trending on GitHub in just 48 hours</a> and there’s some good advice in there, namely <strong>make it easy for people to understand and use</strong>. Reduce the time and effort people have to spend. Reduce friction.</p>
<p>To that end, I’ve rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/0.2.0/README.md">README</a> and created a <a href="https://groundworkrocks.slack.com/">Slack channel</a>. My arbitary but achievable aim is to have <strong>100 stars</strong> for the project by the end of the year. So, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork">give Groundwork a star</a> :)</p>
